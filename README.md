# RLCS EU – Points Progression (Split 1, 2025)

📊 **Visualizing the evolution of RLCS points among Europe’s top 8 teams during Split 1**  
🎮 *A compact data storytelling project combining esports context and Python visualization*

---

## 🧠 Project Summary

This project tracks the RLCS points progression of the 8 best-performing European teams over the first split of the 2025 *Rocket League Championship Series*. The focus is on momentum and ranking shifts across the three regional events.

The goal was to build a compelling, readable line chart to highlight competition trends and demonstrate storytelling through data — using a topic I’m passionate about.

## 🎯 Why This Project?

As a former esports competitor and current data analytics student, I wanted a project that connects both worlds:

- Competitive context I know well  
- Clean narrative with a visual anchor  
- A simple but relevant use of Python tools

This project was also featured in a short [LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7323235935800705026/) as part of my professional transition into analytics.

## 🔜 Potential Next Steps

- Automate data collection via Liquipedia API or scraping
- Compare RLCS EU vs NA progression patterns
- Expand to prize distribution or match-level insights
